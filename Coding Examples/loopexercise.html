  //Now on your own, write a for loop that prints the value of i to the console 5 times

  //Now, write a while loop that sets the value of i to 5 and prints to the console until i is 0

  //Now, write a do/while loop that prints to the console 6 times. The last value of i should be 5.

  //Oh... and don't forget to call your functions.
